Project Reflection

## 1. How do I approach designing software?

Throughout this project, I've developed new design skills and refined my approach to software design, particularly in the context of 3D graphics and visualization.

### New Design Skills:

- I've learned to create complex 3D scenes by combining basic shapes. For example, I constructed a detailed pineapple model using spheres, tapered cylinders, and pyramids.
  
- I've gained experience in designing realistic lighting setups, using multiple light sources with different colors and intensities to create depth and atmosphere.

- I've developed skills in creating and applying textures to 3D objects, enhancing the realism of the scene.

### Design Process:

My design process for this project involved careful consideration of object selection, arrangement, and visual properties. I started with a concept of a still-life fruit scene and then broke it down into components:

1. Selecting appropriate basic shapes to represent each fruit
   
2. Designing the lighting setup to create a balanced and appealing atmosphere
   
3. Crafting materials for each object, considering properties like color, shininess, and texture
   
4. Arranging objects in the scene for an aesthetically pleasing composition using x, y, and z coordinates 

### Future Application:

The tactics I've used in this project, such as breaking down complex objects into simpler components and iterative refinement of visual properties, can be applied to future work in various fields. Whether designing user interfaces, data visualizations, or other graphical applications, this structured approach to design will be valuable.

## 2. How do I approach developing programs?

### New Development Strategies:

- I implemented a modular approach, creating separate functions for different aspects of the scene (e.g., SetupSceneLight(), DefineObjectMaterials()).
  
- I used object-oriented programming principles to manage different aspects of the 3D scene (SceneManager, ViewManager, ShaderManager).

### Iteration in Development:

Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. I started with basic shapes and gradually refined them, adding complexity and detail. For example, the fruit boxes began as simple cubes and were later enhanced with transparency effects.

### Evolution of Approach:

Throughout the milestones leading to the project's completion, my approach evolved from focusing on individual components to considering the scene as a whole. I learned to balance performance with visual quality, and to structure my code for better maintainability and flexibility.

## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### Educational Gains:

Computational graphics and visualizations have given me a deeper understanding of:

- 3D mathematics and transformations
  
- Lighting and shading algorithms
  
- The graphics pipeline and OpenGL
  
These skills provide a solid foundation for further study in fields like computer vision, virtual reality, or advanced rendering techniques.

### Professional Possibilities:

The knowledge and skills I've gained are directly applicable to various professional fields:

- Game development: Creating 3D environments and objects
  
- Data visualization: Representing complex data in intuitive visual formats
  
- User interface design: Understanding how to create visually appealing and functional interfaces for use in UI/UX
  
- Simulation and modeling: Building realistic 3D simulations for training or analysis purposes

This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my ability to approach complex problems systematically, a valuable skill in any professional setting.
